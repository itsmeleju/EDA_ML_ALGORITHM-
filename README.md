# ***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Machine Learning algorithms***

*Project Overview*
Machine Learning EDA Project

This project aims to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on dataset to uncover insights related to Car Price and User Data prediction with accuracy rate
The analysis will provide valuable information for predicting and optimize their sales strategies.

This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning algorithms, including:
* **Random Forest**
* **Linear Regression**
* **Decision Tree**

**Key Features:**

* **Clean and Commented Code:** The code is well-structured, easy to read, and includes comments to explain the logic and key steps.
* **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Includes basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and data preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, featuring standard scaling) while applying the algorithms.
* **Model Evaluation:** Provides functions for evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, R-squared).
